Policy 107-CAN: Policy on Nondiscrimination and Equal Opportunity (CAN)


Northeastern University is committed to providing equal opportunity to its students and employees, and to eliminating discrimination when it occurs. This Policy applies to all members of the university community, including students, faculty, staff, affiliates, and volunteers when acting on behalf of the university, whether on or off campus, as well as to contractors, parents, and visitors when they are on university property.

N/A

The university will fulfil its recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation and benefits obligations without reference to an individual’s ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or disability or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal or provincial law.
Any employees with questions or concerns about employment discrimination or harassment in the workplace, are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their supervisor or the Office for University Equity and Compliance. The university will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who raise issues of employment discrimination or harassment in good faith. To ensure our workplace is free of artificial barriers, violation of this Policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for just cause.
