Policy 414: Policy on New Employee Orientation


New Employee Orientation provides an introduction to Northeastern University â€“ our mission, governance, and goals. The program also outlines expectations relating to business conduct and policy, and other policies, introduces the benefits offerings and identifies resources available to assist new employees in their on-boarding at the university.

For purposes of this policy,
A new employee is any benefits eligible employee whether faculty or staff hired, re-hired, or transferring to a benefits-eligible position.
The hiring manager is the manager who interviewed and selected the new employee and who will be the direct supervisor.

All new employees are required to attend New Employee Orientation.
The hiring manager is responsible for making certain that the new employee attends new employee orientation.

Information on registering for your new employee for orientation can be found here: https://service.northeastern.edu/hr?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB000420045
The Office of the Provost conducts orientation for new faculty who are hired at the start of the academic year.
If a new employee misses new employee orientation, the hiring manager is responsible for re-scheduling the new employee for the next new employee orientation.
