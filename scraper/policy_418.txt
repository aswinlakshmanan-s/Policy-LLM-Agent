Policy 418: Policy on Personnel Files


The university maintains a personnel file for each employee.

A personnel file is a record kept by the university’s Human Resources (HR) department that identifies an employee, to the extend that the record is used or has been used, or may affect or be used relative to that employee’s qualifications for employment, promotion, transfer, additional compensation or disciplinary action.

Personnel files are the property of the university. Documents contained in personnel files will be maintained in confidence, except as may be necessary for the business needs of the university and as disclosure may be required by law. Employees are granted access to their own personnel files in accordance with applicable laws.
Employees may review their own personnel files during business hours by requesting an appointment with HR.
Indiviudals outside of the university will not be given access to personnel files without written permission of the employee or as required by law.

Normally, at least 24 hours prior notice to HR will be required for employees to view their personnel file.
