While it is the policy of UHCS to provide medical and behavioral health care services to Northeastern University students, individuals who are not Northeastern University students will receive care only in emergent circumstances. In such circumstances, UHCS healthcare providers will provide emergent, stabilizing care, consistent with their scope of practice, and will arrange for transfer to the appropriate level of care as soon as possible.
