Policy 808: Policy on Student Employee Work Schedule


Student employment is an opportunity for individual students who seek available part time or coop positions on campus to support their educations and gain work experience. To ensure that students appropriately balance their part-time work experience with their academic requirements, this policy specifies the number of hours a student can work each week.

Students enrolled in classes may not exceed 20 hours of work each week. The work week is Sunday â€“ Saturday. Exceptions to this work week are intersessions, break weeks and vacations. Students employed with a co-op on campus may not exceed 40 hours work per week.
