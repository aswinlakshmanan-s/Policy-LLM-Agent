From time to time, employees may be expected to work beyond their established work schedules to meet the business needs of their departments.

From time to time, department heads may arrange short-term alternative work schedules for employees in their departments, provided the alternative work schedules meet the business need of the department and the opportunities for such arrangements are available for all employees.
