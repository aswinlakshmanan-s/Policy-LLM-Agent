Policy 404: Policy on Direct Deposit


Direct deposit has benefits for faculty, staff, students, and the university. It is a safe, cost-effective, and efficient method for payment that provides the most timely way for individuals to receive and access their earnings while eliminating the risk of lost or misplaced checks. This policy establishes the universityâ€™s expectations regarding direct deposit. It applies to anyone who receives payment through university payroll.

N/A

Anyone in Massachusetts will receive payment by direct deposit into a bank account of their choosing. Although participation in direct deposit for anyone outside of Massachusetts is not required, the university strongly encourages enrollment in direct deposit. Anyone outside of Massachusetts who voluntarily chooses direct deposit may un-enroll at any time. The university will not issue any charges for direct deposit.

Direct deposit allocations may be viewed and changed through the secure MyNortheastern portal. Those who elect to receive earnings through direct deposit will also receive authorized and approved travel and other reimbursements by direct deposit.
