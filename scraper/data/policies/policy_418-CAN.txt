Policy 418-CAN: Policy on Personnel Files (CAN)


The university maintains a personnel file for each employee.

A personnel file is a record kept by the university’s HRM department that identifies an employee, to the extent that the record is used or has been used, or may affect or be used relative to that employee’s qualifications for employment, promotion, transfer, additional compensation, or disciplinary action.

Personnel files are the property of theuniversity. Documents contained in personnel files will be maintained in confidence, except as may be necessary for the business needs of the universityand as disclosure may be required by law. Employees are granted access to their own personnel files in accordance with applicable laws.
Employees may review their personnel files during business hours by requesting an appointment with HRM.
Individuals outside of the universitywill not be given access to personnel files without written permission of the employee or as required by law.


Normally, at least 24 hours’ prior notice to HRM will be required for employees to view their personnel file.
